### Summary

This project explores whether international K-pop streaming trends are correlated with tourist arrivals to South Korea. Despite K-pop’s global popularity, analysis found no statistically significant correlation overall. However, regional patterns—especially in Asia and Europe—suggest potential for more nuanced future research.

### Conclusions

* No significant correlation (r = -0.123, p = 0.3235) between K-pop engagement and tourism.

* Regional differences may hint at indirect or lagging effects.

* BTS, BLACKPINK, and TWICE were top in global engagement.
